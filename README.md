# Wokwi Discord Community Rules

## The Spirit

Please be kind to each other. People are here to learn, share knowledge, and help each other. 
Some have more experience than others. But we're here to grow and become better makers.

Keep the discussions focused around electronics, programming, simulation and related topics. 

This discord server should also be a safe place for children and everyone should feel among friends.

## The Rules

1. Do not post the same message to multiple channels.
2. Do not mention multiple people or `@everyone` in your questions.
3. Do not send direct messages to people you don't know and ask for help, unless they first agree.
4. Your user name and profile picture should be appropriate and respectful.
5. Keep all discussions in English, so everyone can read/participate.

Remember: people are helping you in their free time, so be patient, respectful for their time, and appreciative for any assistance you receive.

## School/University Assignments

It is okay to ask for help, guidance, or clarification on your school or university assignments, but it is crucial to maintain academic integrity in all your work. When asking for help:

1. **Read the docs**: Wokwi has [extensive documentation](https://docs.wokwi.com) that includes many *working* examples and detailed explanations.
2. **Be transparent**: Clearly state that the task is part of a school or university assignment.
3. **Focus on learning**: Aim to understand the concepts and processes rather than just obtaining an answer.
4. **Do your own work**: Include a link to the Wokwi project you are working on and explain what you do not understand / what doesn't work as expected.
